Guatemala continues to progress in enhancing digital access and use for all. The share of Internet users increased from 8.3% in 2008 to 65.0% in 2018, which is above the current Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) average (62.9%). Active mobile broadband subscriptions also increased but are below the LAC and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) averages. The country has made progress in enhancing trust in the digital ecosystem, as seen by improvement in perceived trust in online privacy and in the Global Cybersecurity Index. In particular, the Global Cybersecurity Index increased from 0.21 in 2016 to 0.25 in 2018, but remains below LAC (0.43) and OECD (0.79) averages.
