description: The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) is a trusted reference that
  measures the commitment of countries to cybersecurity at a global level – to
  raise awareness of the importance and different dimensions of the issue. As
  cybersecurity has a broad field of application, cutting across many industries
  and various sectors, each country’s level of development or engagement is
  assessed along five pillars – (i) Legal Measures, (ii) Technical Measures,
  (iii) Organizational Measures, (iv) Capacity Development, and (v) Cooperation
  – and then aggregated into an overall score.
