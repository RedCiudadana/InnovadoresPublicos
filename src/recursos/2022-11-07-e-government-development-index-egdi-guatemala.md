description: "The E-Government Development Index presents the state of
  E-Government Development of the United Nations Member States. Along with an
  assessment of the website development patterns in a country, the E-Government
  Development index incorporates the access characteristics, such as the
  infrastructure and educational levels, to reflect how a country is using
  information technologies to promote access and inclusion of its people. The
  EGDI is a composite measure of three important dimensions of e-government,
  namely: provision of online services, telecommunication connectivity and human
  capacity."
