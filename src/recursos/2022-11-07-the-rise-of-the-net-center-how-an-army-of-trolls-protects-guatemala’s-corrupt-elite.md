title: THE RISE OF THE NET CENTER How an Army of Trolls Protects Guatemala’s
  Corrupt Elite
image: /images/posts/inovadores_p-13.png
description: "A counter-campaign surged, mostly online, in defense of Morales,
  and against Velásquez and his commission, which is known by its
  Spanish-language acronym CICIG. Vicious attacks against Velásquez and his
  supporters circulated on Twitter and Facebook, as well as in blasts to
  WhatsApp groups. CICIG was a plot by the United States, an “invasion of
  sovereignty.” Or, it was a communist scheme, “extortion” that would lead to a
  “dictatorship equal to Venezuela, equal to [Hugo] Chávez.” Some of the attacks
  combined these arguments into a confusing mishmash. Velásquez was a stooge, a
  plant, accused of fomenting a coup. His main ally in government, Attorney
  General Thelma Aldana, received the same abuse. The falsehoods flew, often
  clearly originating from fake accounts, but also retweeted and reposted by
  prominent right-wing commentators.  It was the Guatemalan version of a form of
  information warfare now familiar the world over, with a homegrown name: the
  net center."
