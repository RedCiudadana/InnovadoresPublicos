title: Guatemala - Data Protection Overview
image: /images/posts/icono-12.png
description: Guatemala does not have a specific regime dealing with the
  protection of personal data. However, there is legislation that may result
  applicable when processing personal data. In this sense, the Law on Access to
  Public Information (though applicable solely to State entities or entities
  funded by the State) does contain provisions which, because of their drafting,
  result applicable to any sort of personal data processing, including the one
  done by private entities.
